# VamBooru

A potential implementation of a sharing site for [Virt-A-Mate](https://www.patreon.com/meshedvr) scenes.

The goal is to create a site for the community to share scenes, and eventually get them in Virt-A-Mate directly: https://trello.com/c/O61WprH2/15-community-sharing-of-scenes-in-app

  * Auto-tagging (how many males/females, audio, etc.)
  * Basic validation
* Post gallery (searching, filtering and sorting)
* User profiles (usernames)
* Voting
* Tagging and tag searching
